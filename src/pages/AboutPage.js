              <h2>Our Story</h2>
              <p>
                Carsokoni was born from a simple frustration: buying a car shouldn't be complicated,
                time-consuming, or stressful. Our founder, John Smith, experienced this firsthand when
                searching for his family's first car. After visiting multiple dealerships, dealing with
                pushy salespeople, and spending weeks on research, he realized there had to be a better way.
              </p>
              <p>
                In 2020, we launched Carsokoni with a mission to make car shopping transparent, efficient,
                and enjoyable. We've grown from a small startup to become one of the most trusted online
                car marketplaces, helping thousands of customers find their perfect vehicle.
              </p>
              <p>
                Today, we continue to innovate and improve our platform, always putting our customers first.
                Every decision we make is guided by our commitment to quality, transparency, and exceptional service.
